# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
## Software engineering is the process of identifying implementing and deploying computer applications in order to solve real world problems

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
## Traditional programming is the conventional approach of writing code to create specific instructions for a computer to follow. It involves explicitly defining every step and condition, leaving no room for the system to learn or adapt independently while Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process model used to design, develop, test, and maintain the software applications and provides room for adaptation 

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
#### 1.  Planning and Requirement Analysis
#### This crucial stage that involves planning done by the developers at the company.A feasibility study determines whether creating a new or improved system is appropriate. This helps to estimate costs, benefits, resource requirements, and specific user needs.

#### 2.  Design
#### This stage involves software engineers analyzing requirements and describing in detail functions and operations to enable the developers develop the software with minimal additional input
#### 3. Implement
####  The developers begin writing code based on design specifications and dividing the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that makes the product.
#### 4.  Test
#### This process conducting various test on the software to ensure it meets the quality requirements and software requirements and often runs parallel to the development phase and can help hash out any major user experience issues and security issues.

#### 5. Deploy
#### This step involves releasing the software to users and consumers can be automated  depending on the type. 
#### 6. Maintain
#### In the maintenance phase, among other tasks, the team fixes bugs, resolves customer issues, and manages software changes. In addition, the team monitors overall system performance, security, and user experience to identify new ways to improve the existing software.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
